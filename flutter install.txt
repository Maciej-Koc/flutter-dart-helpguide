Download the following installation bundle to get the latest stable release of the Flutter SDK:

For other release channels, and older builds, see the SDK releases page.

Extract the zip file and place the contained flutter in the desired installation location for the Flutter SDK (for example, C:\src\flutter).


    From the Start search bar, enter ‘env’ and select Edit environment variables for your account.
    Under User variables check if there is an entry called Path:
        If the entry exists, append the full path to flutter\bin using ; as a separator from existing values.
        If the entry doesn’t exist, create a new user variable named Path with the full path to flutter\bin as its value.
